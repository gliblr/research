Repository for research code from my phd work

Most of these scripts are simple analysis intended to be used with long textfiles of molecular dynamics simulation data. These data sets typically contain information regarding the atom postions of molecules in simulations frim by the MD engine GROMACS.

Please see my PhD thesis for more information on these scripts.
